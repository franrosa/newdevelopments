# NewDev WordPress Block Theme

NewDev is a simple theme for a site with a blog, focused on being straightforward and accessible, with a fair amount of visual impact. Originally intended to be used on [New Developments blog](http://franrosa.com/blog/), it is also the first block theme I develop and I will be working on it as I learn — and documenting it in the same blog.

> :warning: **This theme is still under development.** You are free to download it, and modify it or use it in any way you want. But it has not been released to be used as is yet, so unless you are a developer or a savvy user, I would not recommend using it for production.
