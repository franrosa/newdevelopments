Block theme for a site with a blog. Straightforward, accessible, without images but with visual impact.

## Description
This theme is meant to be a text based template, mostly for blogs or other websites heavily based on text, but not in a minimal black and white setting, but being colorful and visually interesting.

This is an opinionated theme, idiosyncratic even. For example, it uses a very large and heavy page title with a colour background, instead of a hero image.
Of course images and other media can still be used with these theme, but as it doesn't lean on them, maybe there are less options to use them than in other themes.

The colour palette is very important, having a handful of accent colours that are meant to be alternated for different pages or sections of the site. Creating your own palette can drastically change how the theme looks.
Originally the palette had very bright colours, but after some consideration, they were substituted for a more muted or calmer version to be less strident.

Typography also plays an instrumental role. The theme is designed with Public Sans in mind, so changing it to an extremely different typeface may require some adjustments in the sizes and or spacings to create a suitable vertical rhythm.
It also uses iA Writer Typeface for code, just because it's generally easier to understand code with a monospaced typeface. But if you don't use code blocks you may never see it.

An important aspect is accessibility, so this theme is meant to be accessibility-ready on the WordPress directory.

I created the first version of this theme in 2022 as a learning project, which was very rough on the edges. This new version is meant to be ready to use out of the box.
